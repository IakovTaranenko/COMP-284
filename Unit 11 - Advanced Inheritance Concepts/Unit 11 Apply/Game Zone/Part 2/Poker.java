Unit 11 Game Zone

a. Create an abstract CardGame class similar to the one described in this chapter. The class contains a virtual deck of 52 playing cards that uses a Card class that holds a suit and value for each Card object. It also contains an integer field that holds the number of cards dealt to a player in a particular game. The class contains a constructor that initializes the deck of cards with appropriate values (for example, King of Hearts), and a shuffle() method that randomly arranges the positions of the Cards in the array. The class also contains two abstract methods: displayDescription(), which displays a brief description of the game in each of the child classes, and deal(), which deals the appropriate number of Card objects to one player of a game. Save the file as CardGame.java.

b. Create two child classes that extend CardGame. You can choose any games you prefer. For example, you might create a Poker class or a Bridge class. Create a constructor for each child class that initializes the field that holds the number of cards dealt to the correct value. (For example, in standard poker, a player receives 5 cards, but in bridge, a player receives 13.) Create an appropriate displayDescription() and deal() method for each child class. Save each file using an appropriate nameâ€”for example, Poker.java or Bridge.java.

c. Create an application that instantiates one object of each game type and demonstrates that the methods work correctly. Save the application as PlayCardGames.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
