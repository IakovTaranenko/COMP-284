Programming Exercise 11-10

Create an abstract class called GeometricFigure. Add height, width, and figure attributes. Include an abstract method figureArea to determine the area of the figure. Create two subclasses called Square and Triangle. Define the constructor and figureArea method of each subclass.

The UseGeometric.java file has been provided to test the implementations.
