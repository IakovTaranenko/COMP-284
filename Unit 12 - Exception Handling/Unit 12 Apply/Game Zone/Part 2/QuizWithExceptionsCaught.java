/* 

Unit 12 Game Zone

In Chapter 8, you created a Quiz class that contains an array of 10 multiple-choice questions to which the user was required to respond with an A, B, or C. At the time, you knew how to handle the user's response if an invalid character was entered. Rerun the program now to determine whether an exception is thrown if the user enters nothingâ€”that is, the user just presses the Enter key without making an entry. If so, improve the program by catching the exception, displaying an appropriate error message, and presenting the same question to the user again. Save the file as QuizWithExceptionsCaught.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
