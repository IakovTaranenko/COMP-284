Unit 12 Case Problems

In Chapter 11, you created an interactive StaffDinnerEvent class that obtains all the data for a dinner event for Carly's Catering, including details about the staff members required to work at the event. Now, modify the class so that it becomes immune to user data entry errors by handling exceptions for each numeric entry. Each time the program requires numeric data—for example, for the number of guests, selected menu options, and staff members' salaries—continuously prompt the user until the data entered is the correct type. Save the revised program as guests, selected menu options, and staff members' salaries—continuously prompt the user until the data entered is the correct type. Save the revised program as StaffDinnerEvent.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
