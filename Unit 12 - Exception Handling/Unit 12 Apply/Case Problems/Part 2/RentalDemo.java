Unit 12 Case Problems

In Chapter 11, you created an interactive RentalDemo class that obtains all the data for four rentals from Sammy's Seashore Rentals, including details about the contract number, length of the rental, and equipment type. Now, modify the class so that it becomes immune to user data entry errors by handling exceptions for each numeric entry. Each time the program requires numeric data—for example, for the rental period—continuously prompt the user until the data entered is the correct type. Save the revised program as RentalDemo.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
