Programming Exercise 12-12

In a “You Do It” section of this chapter, you created a CalculatorDemo program that asked the user to solve an arithmetic problem and provided the system calculator for assistance. Now modify that program to include the following improvements:

• Both numbers in the arithmetic problem should be random integers between 1 and 5,000.

• The program should ask the user to solve five problems.

• The program should handle any noninteger data entry by displaying an appropriate message and continuing with the next problem.

An example of the program is shown below:

What is the sum of 1344 and 7358? >> five?
Invalid answer. Try again.
What is the sum of 278 and 1156? >> 1434
Correct!
What is the sum of 1421 and 7389? >> Next
Invalid answer. Try again.
What is the sum of 4189 and 8324? >> 12513

What is the sum of 8431 and 2905? >> 11336
